A tool that integrates with google spreadsheet and invites people on LinkedIn through a dedicated chrome extension that works in the browser and using jQuery it injects code after load of LinkedIn, then scrape profiles that are out there and then visits the pages, connects etc. and goes in loops. But the loop is never the same, it figures out new ways to interact. Integrate with OpenAI.
